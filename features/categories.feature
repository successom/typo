Feature: Add and change categories
  As a blog administrator
  I want to add and change categories

  Background:
    Given the blog is set up
    And I am logged into the admin panel

  Scenario: Successfully adding categories
    Given I am on the categories page
    #When I fill in "article_title" with "Hello Ruby!"
    #And I fill in "article__body_and_extended_editor" with "Great language!"
    #And I press "Publish"
    #Then I should be on the admin content page
    #When I go to the home page
    #Then I should see "Hello Ruby!"
    #When I follow "Hello Ruby!"
    #Then I should see "Great language!"
